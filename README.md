## Installation
Required packages: Simply run an 'npm install' in the parent directory prior to testing. I accessed npm's inquirer package in developing the question prompts & npm's jest package in order to pass the tests at each stage in development.
  
## Tests
To test, run the following command: First you'll need to run an 'npm install' in the parent directory. Second, you'll want to open your command terminal to the directory containing app.js and type 'node app.js'. Upon completing the final question and selecting the 'home' input option your 'team.html' file will appear in the output/ folder. *bonus: navigate to the test/ folder in your command terminal and run an 'npm test' to see the glossy finish!
